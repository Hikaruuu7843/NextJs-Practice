This event becomes his drive and motivation to find a cure for her and turn her back into a human. To this end, he decided to join the Demon Slayer Corps. He initially trained under Sakonji Urokodaki, learning the Water Breathing (水の呼吸, Mizu no kokyū) sword style. Later, Tanjiro began using his family's Hinokami Kagura (ヒノカミ神楽, lit. Dance of the Fire God) technique based on the original breath style, Sun Breathing (日の呼吸, Hi no kokyū). Tanjiro would then merge both methods to create a more sustainable fighting style.

Despite Muzan's assumption that he killed them all in his attempt to sire a sunlight-resistant demon, Nezuko survives as a demon with her mind mostly gone. However, she retains enough of her memories to keep herself from killing Tanjiro. Due to two years of hypnotic conditioning by Urokodaki, Nezuko regards all humans as her family and will mercilessly attack any demon that threatens them. Instead of consuming human flesh, Nezuko regains energy from sleep and tends to become unconscious for long periods of time after overexerting herself. Initially, she is unable to speak and must wear a bamboo muzzle, given to her by Giyu Tomioka, to keep from biting anyone. However in later volumes, the muzzle is removed and she gains the power of speech, albeit broken due to not speaking for more than two years. Nezuko has the standard powers of demons, including regeneration, superhuman strength, growing and shrinking rapidly, and a Blood Demon Art called Exploding Blood (爆血, Bakketsu) that causes her blood to burn once it leaves her body. Tanjiro generally carries her around in a wooden box (a gift from Urokodaki) until she develops the ability to survive exposure to sunlight, with Muzan targeting her soon after. Nezuko's mind and humanity are eventually restored during the final battle against Muzan Kibutsuji.",

Zenitsu trained in the Thunder Breathing (雷の呼吸, Kaminari no kokyū) style by the former Thunder Hashira but was only able to learn the first form, and because of this he often belittles himself, despite the fact that he is talented. He joins up with Tanjiro on a mission and since then, he has tagged along with him, partially out of his infatuation with Nezuko, but also due to recognizing how honest and kind he is. His cowardly personality initially hinders him and he is only able to fight when he is unconscious or asleep, but he later learns to push his fears aside and take action when needed, to the point of developing a new, exclusive Thunder Breathing form.

Inosuke Hashibira (嘴平 伊之助, Hashibira Inosuke) uses a self-taught style called Beast Breathing (獣の呼吸, Kedamono no kokyū), along with two serrated swords in battle. When he gets new swords, he purposely chips them in order to match his preference and fighting style (much to his swordsmith's anger). Like Zenitsu, Inosuke is occasional comic relief for the series. He is portrayed as brash and prone to reacting violently, and while he appears dim, he proves himself in battle time after time. He is drawn as extremely muscular and rugged, which contrasts with his oddly effeminate face, which he normally hides under a boar's head mask. This mask was made from the head of his deceased boar mother, and he wears it in memory of her. When Inosuke first meets Tanjiro, he treats him as an enemy, but they quickly become friends as they fight together. He often challenges Tanjiro to competitions that are accepted in good spirits. He took the Demon Slayer Corps test at the same time as Tanjiro and Zenitsu and, unknown to most, became the first to clear it. Inosuke's swords are colored blue-grey.

He killed his doctor before realizing it worked. Muzan has since dedicated himself to complete his treatment by siring demons that would help him achieve his goal of overcoming his one weakness, sunlight. He also expressed a justified concern towards those who utilized the Sun Breathing technique since his near-death experience from fighting Yoriichi Tsugikuni. This motivated him to attack Tanjiro's family in an attempt of turning at least one of them into a demon that was naturally immune to sunlight. Nezuko, the only survivor of the incident, eventually manifested that ability and Muzan focused his efforts on capturing and devouring her to remove his only weakness.

                "info": "Suzaku Kururugi, born on July 10, 2000 a.t.b., is the son of Japan's last prime minister, Genbu Kururugi. His existence was kept secret from the public until after the war. Suzaku met Lelouch vi Britannia and his sister Nunnally vi Britannia when they moved to the Kururugi residence as a diplomatic peace trade. Initially, Suzaku thought Lelouch was a selfish prince and despised him. However, as time passed, he came to know Lelouch better, and they soon became best friends. They were separated when Britannia invaded Japan but were reunited in the Shinjuku Ghetto. When Britannia began its invasion of Japan, Suzaku was mortified by the violence and his father's belief that resisting to the bitter end was preferable to surrendering. Unable to change his father's mind, Suzaku murdered him during a heated exchange. The incident was covered up and Suzaku's life was spared, while the government was thrown into disarray and surrendered to Britannia. Lelouch believes that, had Genbu lived, Japan likely would have been torn apart by war once the other major powers decided to intervene. His guilt over the incident causes Suzaku to constantly place himself on the frontlines in the hope of atoning for his actions with his death. It also inspires his belief that the ends achieved with immoral means are meaningless since he created peace through murder. However, after firing the F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead, under the command of Lelouch's Geass, he abandons this belief and decides to achieve his goals regardless of the means. This causes him to finally join Lelouch.",

Euphemia is Lelouch vi Britannia's half-sister and the sister he cared most about after Nunnally. Euphemia was the Sub-Viceroy of Area 11, a role she admittedly did not enjoy. Euphemia admired her older sister, Cornelia, but despised all combat in general, though was capable of piloting a Knightmare Frame. She returns at the fifth archive where it is revealed that she was kept out of commission, hidden with her death being faked, and managed to be recover with the help of the Ragnarök. It is revealed that the Geass casted on her also had the order to live, similar to Suzaku, with Lelouch knowing that after the order to kill the japanese would kill her and was used as a scapegoat, with Lelouch's goal was to make Euphemia a guide for Nunnally when she becomes the Empress.",
