This event becomes his drive and motivation to find a cure for her and turn her back into a human. To this end, he decided to join the Demon Slayer Corps. He initially trained under Sakonji Urokodaki, learning the Water Breathing (水の呼吸, Mizu no kokyū) sword style. Later, Tanjiro began using his family's Hinokami Kagura (ヒノカミ神楽, lit. Dance of the Fire God) technique based on the original breath style, Sun Breathing (日の呼吸, Hi no kokyū). Tanjiro would then merge both methods to create a more sustainable fighting style. His skull is exceptionally thick, and his headbutts are used as gags throughout the series. He is characterized as a pure and kind-hearted individual, always looking after the well-being of his comrades and sympathizing with the plight of demons",

She was turned into a demon during her family's massacre. Her character functions as motivation and support for Tanjiro. Despite Muzan's assumption that he killed them all in his attempt to sire a sunlight-resistant demon, Nezuko survives as a demon with her mind mostly gone. However, she retains enough of her memories to keep herself from killing Tanjiro. Due to two years of hypnotic conditioning by Urokodaki, Nezuko regards all humans as her family and will mercilessly attack any demon that threatens them. Instead of consuming human flesh, Nezuko regains energy from sleep and tends to become unconscious for long periods of time after overexerting herself. Initially, she is unable to speak and must wear a bamboo muzzle, given to her by Giyu Tomioka, to keep from biting anyone. However in later volumes, the muzzle is removed and she gains the power of speech, albeit broken due to not speaking for more than two years. Nezuko has the standard powers of demons, including regeneration, superhuman strength, growing and shrinking rapidly, and a Blood Demon Art called Exploding Blood (爆血, Bakketsu) that causes her blood to burn once it leaves her body. Tanjiro generally carries her around in a wooden box (a gift from Urokodaki) until she develops the ability to survive exposure to sunlight, with Muzan targeting her soon after. Nezuko's mind and humanity are eventually restored during the final battle against Muzan Kibutsuji.",

His cowardly personality is also used to contrast with Tanjiro's determined character. Zenitsu trained in the Thunder Breathing (雷の呼吸, Kaminari no kokyū) style by the former Thunder Hashira but was only able to learn the first form, and because of this he often belittles himself, despite the fact that he is talented. He joins up with Tanjiro on a mission and since then, he has tagged along with him, partially out of his infatuation with Nezuko, but also due to recognizing how honest and kind he is. His cowardly personality initially hinders him and he is only able to fight when he is unconscious or asleep, but he later learns to push his fears aside and take action when needed, to the point of developing a new, exclusive Thunder Breathing form. Zenitsu's sword is colored yellow and has a lightning bolt design. He has a heightened sense of hearing which allows him to distinguish a person's true character by the sound of their heartbeat and track demons.",

After she sacrificed herself to save his life, he was raised by wild boars, and then taught to read and write by an old man. Inosuke Hashibira (嘴平 伊之助, Hashibira Inosuke) uses a self-taught style called Beast Breathing (獣の呼吸, Kedamono no kokyū), along with two serrated swords in battle. When he gets new swords, he purposely chips them in order to match his preference and fighting style (much to his swordsmith's anger). Like Zenitsu, Inosuke is occasional comic relief for the series. He is portrayed as brash and prone to reacting violently, and while he appears dim, he proves himself in battle time after time. He is drawn as extremely muscular and rugged, which contrasts with his oddly effeminate face, which he normally hides under a boar's head mask. This mask was made from the head of his deceased boar mother, and he wears it in memory of her. When Inosuke first meets Tanjiro, he treats him as an enemy, but they quickly become friends as they fight together. He often challenges Tanjiro to competitions that are accepted in good spirits. He took the Demon Slayer Corps test at the same time as Tanjiro and Zenitsu and, unknown to most, became the first to clear it. Inosuke's swords are colored blue-grey. He has a heightened sense of touch, being able to locate enemies by feeling the vibrations in the air.",
